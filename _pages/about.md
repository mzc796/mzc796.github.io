I am an assistant professor in Computer Science at **Kansas State University**. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Penn State University. I was honored to be advised by [Tom La Porta](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~tfl12/) and [Trent Jaeger](https://www.trentjaeger.com/). I am also grateful for the collaboration and guidance from [Teryl Taylor](https://research.ibm.com/people/teryl-taylor) and [Fred Araujo](https://research.ibm.com/people/frederico-araujo). My research focuses on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) security, optimization for defense placement, P4 programming, and machine learning–assisted security. My work has appeared in ACM CCS and USENIX Security and has led to the disclosure of multiple CVEs affecting widely used SDN controllers. I have hands-on experience with open-source SDN platforms, having contributed code to OpenDaylight earlier in my career. I conducted research supported by Army Research Lab funding and a collaboration with IBM Research. I also serve on program committees and artifact evaluation boards in the security community.

## PhD Openings
I am recruiting **two fully funded PhD students for Spring or Fall 2026** to design and build a next-generation SDN testbed. Research topics include:

- **SDN-orchestrated Smart Agriculture**: Our flagship *vertical*, where a unified orchestrator securely coordinates UAVs, in-field sensors, and edge compute via an SDN controller—abstracting heterogeneous resources and enabling closed-loop sensing-to-actuation for crop monitoring and management, supporting food security.  
  > **Why smart agriculture?** We maintain active collaborations with precision-agriculture faculty at K-State.
- **Security & Privacy of next-G Network Slicing**: Security — enforce trustworthy network state to maintain Service Level Agreement (SLA), isolation, and correct slice routing/placement in network slicing, preventing controller–ground-truth mismatches. Privacy — share synthetic per-slice views that reveal only what’s needed for coordination and resource negotiation.
- **Security of SDN and Programmable Data Planes**: Build a protocol-agnostic security toolbox—combining misuse-driven testing, interface-aware fuzzing, and dynamic invariants—to uncover and mitigate cross-layer vulnerabilities.
**How to apply:** Please email your CV, transcript, and a brief research statement.

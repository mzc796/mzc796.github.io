**This is the security I strive for:**
- **Light-weight:** Minimal overhead and low friction to deploy.
- **Ecosystem-native:** Fits naturally into existing systems and workflowsâ€”no bolt-ons.
- **Stealthy while protecting:** Quiet by default; visible when it matters.
- **Resilient:** Failsafe and degrades gracefully.
- **Measurable:** Clear objectives and evidence of impact.

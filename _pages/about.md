This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!


======
Welcome to Mingming's webpage! I am an incoming assistant professor in Computer Science at Kansas State University. I recently earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Penn State University. I am honored to be advised by [Tom La Porta](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~tfl12/) and [Trent Jaeger](https://www.trentjaeger.com/). I am also grateful for the collaboration and guidance from [Teryl Taylor](https://research.ibm.com/people/teryl-taylor) and [Fred Araujo](https://research.ibm.com/people/frederico-araujo). My research focuses on network security, with interests in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) security, optimization for defense placement, P4 programming, and machine learning–assisted security. My work has appeared in ACM CCS and USENIX Security and has led to the disclosure of multiple CVEs affecting widely used SDN controllers. I have hands-on experience with open-source SDN platforms, having contributed code to OpenDaylight earlier in my career. I conducted research supported by Army Research Lab funding and a collaboration with IBM Research. I also serve on program committees and artifact evaluation boards in the security community.
